## What is Quickwords?
Quickwords is an open-source alternative to [Text Expander](https://textexpander.com) written in [Electron](https://electronjs.org). It is available on MacOS (other systems coming very soon).

## Installation
### MacOS
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/quickwords/quickwords/releases/latest), unzip and drag `Quickwords.app` to your `Applications` folder.

### Linux & Windows
Linux and Windows versions of the app are coming soon. In the meantime all PRs are very welcome.

## Privacy and Security
Quickwords registers all global keyboard events, so it has an access to everything you type on the system. No data is saved on the system, and only 20 last keystrokes are remembered in the memory of the app. All your data should be absolutely secure.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Quickwords, please DM [@quickwordsapp](https://twitter.com/quickwordsapp). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## FAQ
### macOS doesn't allow me to start the app
On macOS Sierra and newer, if you try to open an app that is not signed by an identified developer you get a warning dialog. To override your security settings and open the app:

In the Finder, locate the app you want to open.
Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.
